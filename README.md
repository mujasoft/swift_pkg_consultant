**`swift_pkg_consultant`** is a CLI tool that uses a local LLM (e.g. `llama3` via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)) to analyze your `Package.swift` and provide:

- SwiftPM best practice recommendations
- A SwiftPM Health Score out of 100
- Clean, terminal-friendly output (powered by `rich`)

This is built for Swift developers who want better insights into their package structure.

## Why this exists?

I wanted a tool that can work offline and help me improve, review and audit the quality of packages without having to
go online.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mujasoft/swift_pkg_consultant.git
cd swift_pkg_consultant
pip3 install -r rquirements.txt
```

Requires:
- Python 3.9+.
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) installed and running.
- A downloaded model like `llama3`.
---

## Usage

### Analyze a SwiftPM package

```bash
swift_pkg_consultant -p ./Package.swift # default output filename
```

### Output to file

```bash
swift_pkg_consultant analyse -p ./Package.swift -o review.txt
```

### Only show health score

```bash
swift_pkg_consultant analyse -p ./Package.swift --score-only
```

---

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-p, --package` | Path to your `Package.swift` (required) |
| `-o, --output`  | Output file path for the review (default: `review.txt`) |
| `-m, --model`   | LLM model to use (default: `llama3`) |
| `-q, --quiet-mode` | Suppress terminal output |
| `-s, --score-only` | Only display the SwiftPM Health Score |

â”‚  The Swift package for MujaTools appears to be a good starting point, but there are some areas that can be improved upon. Here's a breakdown of the findings:                                                    â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                  â”‚
â”‚  ### Potential Problems or Omissions                                                                                                                                                                             â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                  â”‚
â”‚  * The `swift-tools-version` declaration specifies version 5.9, which may not be compatible with the latest Swift compiler versions. It's recommended to use the latest supported version (e.g.,                 â”‚
â”‚  `swift-tools-version:6.0`) for future-proofing.                                                                                                                                                                 â”‚
â”‚  * There is no explicit `description` property defined for the package or its products. This makes it harder for users to understand what the package does and why they might want to include it in their        â”‚
â”‚  project.                                                                                                                                                                                                        â”‚
â”‚  * The `platforms` declaration only includes macOS (v12) and iOS (v15), which may limit the package's usefulness on other platforms.                                                                             â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                  â”‚
â”‚  ### Recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                             â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                  â”‚
â”‚  * **Modularity**: Consider breaking down the `MujaCore` target into smaller, more focused modules or subtargets. This will make it easier to reuse individual components in other projects.                     â”‚
â”‚  * **Platform Support**: Expand the `platforms` declaration to include support for watchOS and tvOS, if applicable.                                                                                              â”‚
â”‚  * **Testing**: While there is a test target (`MujaCoreTests`) defined, consider adding more specific testing metadata (e.g., `.testTarget(name: "MujaCoreTests", dependencies: ["MujaCore"], executable:        â”‚
â”‚  true)`). This will help users understand how to run the tests and what they cover.                                                                                                                              â”‚
â”‚  * **Plugins**: If the package provides plugins or extensions for other packages or frameworks, consider defining them as separate targets within this package.                                                  â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                  â”‚
â”‚  ### Suggested Improvements                                                                                                                                                                                      â”‚
