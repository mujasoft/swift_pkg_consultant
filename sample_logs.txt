**SwiftPM Review**

The Swift package for MujaTools appears to be a good starting point, but there are some areas that can be improved upon. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

### Potential Problems or Omissions

* The `swift-tools-version` declaration specifies version 5.9, which may not be compatible with the latest Swift compiler versions. It's recommended to use the latest supported version (e.g., `swift-tools-version:6.0`) for future-proofing.
* There is no explicit `description` property defined for the package or its products. This makes it harder for users to understand what the package does and why they might want to include it in their project.
* The `platforms` declaration only includes macOS (v12) and iOS (v15), which may limit the package's usefulness on other platforms.

### Recommendations

* **Modularity**: Consider breaking down the `MujaCore` target into smaller, more focused modules or subtargets. This will make it easier to reuse individual components in other projects.
* **Platform Support**: Expand the `platforms` declaration to include support for watchOS and tvOS, if applicable.
* **Testing**: While there is a test target (`MujaCoreTests`) defined, consider adding more specific testing metadata (e.g., `.testTarget(name: "MujaCoreTests", dependencies: ["MujaCore"], executable: true)`). This will help users understand how to run the tests and what they cover.
* **Plugins**: If the package provides plugins or extensions for other packages or frameworks, consider defining them as separate targets within this package.

### Suggested Improvements

* Add a `description` property to provide a brief summary of what the package does:
```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "MujaTools",
    description: "A collection of tools and libraries for Muja development",
    // ...
)
```
* Consider adding platform-specific metadata (e.g., `.platforms([.watchOS(.v7), .tvOS(.v15)])`) to support additional platforms.

### SwiftPM Health Score

SwiftPM Health Score: 42/100

The package has a solid foundation, but there are opportunities for improvement in terms of modularity, platform support, and testing. By addressing these areas, the package can become more robust and easier to maintain.

**Recommendation**: Continue to review and refine the package configuration to improve its overall health score.
